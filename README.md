# MAMBA #

These codes accompany the paper "Policy Improvement from Multiple Experts" by Ching-An Cheng, Andrey Kolobov, and Alekh Agarwal.

### Run experiments ###
Update `PYTHONPATH` to include the repo, if not already.
```
source start.sh
```
Run a single script.
```
python scripts/mamba.py
```
The configs of the experiments and the hyperparameters can be set by the dict named `CONFIG` in scripts/mamba.py. The default setting runs MAMBA with ADAM and two weak experts (policy_15). Increasing the index number of `CONFIG['expert_info']['name']` uses better experts.

Batch run scripts/mamba.py with a set of different configurations given as a dict named `range_common` in `scripts/mamba_ranges.py`
```
python batch_run.py mamba -r common
```
The experimental results are saved in folders starting with `log_` in the top folder of the repo.



### Installation ###
Tested in buntu 18.04 with python 3.7.

#### Install mamba and most of the requirements ####
Install this repo and requirements:
```
git clone https://github.com/chinganc/mamba.git
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
You may need to run
```
export PYTHONPATH="{PYTHONPATH}:[the parent folder of mamba repo]"
```
The current version requires also tensorflow2.
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

Below we install DartENV that was used in producing the experiments in the paper. Other gym environments can also be used.


#### Install DART ####
The Ubuntu package is too new for PyDart2, so we install it manually.

First install the requirements following the instructions of Install DART from source at https://dartsim.github.io/install_dart_on_ubuntu.html.
Next we compile and install DART manually, because PyDart2 only supports DART before 6.8.
```
git clone git://github.com/dartsim/dart.git
cd dart
git checkout tags/v6.7.2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```
Someitmes the library may need to be linked manually.
```
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib" >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Install PyDart2 ####
Installing PyDart2 through pip does not work, so we install it manually.
```
git clone https://github.com/sehoonha/pydart2.git
cd pydart2
python setup.py build build_ext
python setup.py develop
```


#### Install DartEnv ####
This is a slightly modified version of [DartEnv](https://github.com/DartEnv/dart-env). The changes include:

* Make nodisplay as default.
* Add a state property for convenience.

To install it,
```
git clone https://github.com/gtrll/dartenv.git
cd dartenv
git checkout nodisplay
pip install -e .[dart]
```
